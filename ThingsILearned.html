        <h1>What is this?</h1>
        <p>To me, the worst feeling in life is the feeling of idleness. The feeling you get when you spend the whole day at home without accomplishing anything. I mean, there were 24 perfectly good hours that were just wasted. Now, the summer tends to promote this type of behavior, but I really don't believe in it. That's because the best feeling in life is the feeling of accomplishment and productivity; the feeling that you get after finishing a project, reading a book, or learning something new and exciting. It's not always easy to find this feeling in your day. There's so many things to get in the way, and there are so many hours of sleep to catch up on.</p>
        <p>My goal is to never feel like I wasted the day away. My goal is to push myself to learn something new every day.</p>
        <p>This blog will feature a new post every day that outlines what I learned and how I learned it. Some of them might even feature videos. If you have an idea for something new I should learn, drop me an email: isaacrwasserman@gmail.com.</p>

            <p>For my first day of learning, I spent a few hours with my grandfather (or Zayde) learning Yiddish words and phrases. Zayde grew up speaking Yiddish with his parents who immigrated from the Ukraine as kids. We also talked about where and why people still speak Yiddish today.</p>
